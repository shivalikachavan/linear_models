```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

set.seed(1)

data(nyc_airbnb)
```

```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(stars = review_scores_location / 2) |> 
  rename(borough = neighbourhood_group) |> 
  filter(borough != "Staten Island") |> 
  select(price, stars, borough, room_type, neighbourhood)
```

Do regression
```{r}
fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Additional cleaning and then re fit. Now comparing to Manhattan instead of Bronx. 
```{r}
nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb |> 
  mutate(
    borough = fct_infreq(borough),
    room_type = fct_infreq(room_type)
  )

fit = lm(price ~ stars + borough, data = nyc_airbnb)
```

Look at results of `lm`
```{r}
summary(fit)
```
